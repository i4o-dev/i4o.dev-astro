					I read books regularly. I'm always reading two books at any
					time â€” one fiction and one non-fiction. I've grouped the
					books in the following categories: currently reading, on my
					reading list, and read in the past.

					I recently started taking notes of some of the books I'm
					reading. I'm publishing them here on my site. You can check
					them out on the <Link
						href='/book-notes'
						label='book notes'
						isUnderline
						target='_self'
					/>.
