				<p>Hi! I'm a software engineer residing in Bangalore, India.</p>
				<p>
					In my free time, I work on <Link
						href='/projects'
						label='side projects'
						isUnderline
						target='_self'
					/>.
				</p>
				<p>
					My main programming language is JavaScript/TypeScript but
					I've been learning Rust as well. I've also dabbled in Go,
					Lua, and Python. I write articles regularly about the things
					I'm learning and the projects I'm working on.
				</p>
				<p>
					When not working on side projects, I read and occasionally
					play video games. Check out what I'm reading and playing
					right <Link
						href='/now'
						label='now'
						isUnderline
						target='_self'
					/>. You can also check out the <Link
						href='/uses'
						label='tools and devices'
						isUnderline
						target='_self'
					/> I use to get my work done.
				</p>
				<p>
					Since you're here, I'd appreciate it if you checked out some
					of my <Link
						href='/posts'
						label='articles'
						isUnderline
						target='_self'
					/>. And if you happen to like what you read, let me know :)
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm most active on these two platforms. If you're interested
					in what I'm doing or what I'm saying, do give me a follow
					here:
